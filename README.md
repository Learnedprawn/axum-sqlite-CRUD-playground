<!-- 1) Completed the rust book and the rustlings excercises for a basic understanding of rust. -->
<!---->
<!-- 2) Discussed with ChatGPT about the high level structure and architecture of the project. -->

<!-- 3) Decided on the Axum for web APIs, because it might be the right mix of complexity and utility to provide both learning and progress. -->
<!---->
<!-- 4) Tried to look at Axum docs and understood very little so I am taking a step back and looking at the tokio crate first. -->
<!---->
<!-- 5) Referencing Jon Gjensat's Videos to learn about tokio and axum: -->

# 🦀 rustqlite

A journey to build a **SQLite-inspired database from scratch in Rust**, with a modern **Axum-based API layer**.  
This project is purely for **learning**, exploration, and fun (and maybe a sprinkle of masochism 🧠💥).

---

## 📚 Learning Plan & Progress

1. ✅ **Completed** [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and `rustlings` for foundational Rust knowledge.

2. 💬 **Discussed high-level architecture** and design goals with ChatGPT (aka rubber ducking with extra RAM).

3. 🧩 **Chose Axum** for the API layer – a solid middle-ground between complexity and power.

4. 🤯 **Paused Axum** exploration after realizing I needed a better async foundation. Switching gears to understand **Tokio** first.

5. 🎥 **Watching Jon Gjengset's excellent videos** to get hands-on understanding:
   - [Axum Deep Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnb_n5YktO8)
   - [Tokio Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ob8zkeq2s)

6. 🛠️ **Plan**: Finish these videos, build the Axum API layer first, then dive deep into **writing the database engine** from scratch.

## 🔭 Project Goals (WIP)
- A working REST API to query a custom DB engine.
- Implement minimal SQL-like operations (CRUD).
- Learn about memory management, disk I/O, and indexing.
- Appreciate why people don’t casually build databases 😅
