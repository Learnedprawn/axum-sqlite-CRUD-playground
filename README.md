# rustqlite

Steps I am taking to learn/build:

1) Completed the rust book and the rustlings excercises for a basic understanding of rust.

2) Discussed with ChatGPT about the high level structure and architecture of the project.

3) Decided on the Axum for web APIs, because it might be the right mix of complexity and utility to provide both learning and progress.

4) Tried to look at Axum docs and understood very little so I am taking a step back and looking at the tokio crate first.

5) Referencing Jon Gjensat's Videos to learn about tokio and axum:

    Tokio Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ob8zkeq2s

6) First will complete these videos and try to build the API to the database before starting the actual database.
